# About this project.

<p align='justify'>
This small app was my take on an app to track my daily macronutrients, as with most of the ones I used I didn't enjoy their UI/UX for one reason or another.
So with that in mind, I started this project as a goal to create something which I enjoyed using daily, as well as to learn how to code using Flutter's framework.

I will keep adding features as I think of them, or I find them missing from my daily use, but for now the app is in a usable state for what my needs are.

## Features.

- Simple and clean UI for an easy experience.
- Ability to easily set up different macronutrient goals for each day of the week.
- Ability to drag food from one meal to another for easy editing.
- Supports both Spanish and English languages.
